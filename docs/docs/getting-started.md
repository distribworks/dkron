#Getting started

Welcome to the intro guide to dkron! This will explain how to setup dkron, how easy is to use it, what problems could it help you to solve, etc.

## Introduction

Dkron nodes can work in two modes, agents or servers.

Servers are agents too. You can use servers to run jobs.

The main distinction is that servers order job executions and can be used to schedule jobs.

Dkron clusters have a leader, the leader is responsible of executing jobs in the cluster.

Any Dkron agent or server acts as a cluster member and it's available to run scheduled tasks.

You can choose whether a job is run on a node or nodes by specifying tags and a count of target nodes having this tag do you want a job to run. This gives an unprecedented level of flexibility in runnig jobs across a cluster of any size and with any combination of machines you need.

All the execution responses will be gathered by the scheduler and stored in the database.

## Requirements

Dkron relies on the key-value store for data storage, you can run an instance of the distributed store in the same machines as Dkron or connect it to your existing cluster.

It can use etcd, Consul or Zookeeper as data stores. To install any of this systems got to their web site:

- [etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/)
- [Consul](https://consul.io/intro/getting-started/install.html)
- [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.3/zookeeperStarted.html)

## Installation

### Recommended method

APT repository: `deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/victorcoder/ /`

Unstable release: `sudo apt-get install dkron-unstable`
Stable release: `sudo apt-get install dkron`

### Other methods

Simply download the packaged archive for your platform from the [downloads page](https://github.com/victorcoder/dkron/releases), extract the package to a shared location in your drive, like `/opt/local` and run it from there.

## Configuration

See the [configuration section](configuration).

## Usage

By default Dkron uses the following ports:

- `8946` for communicating between agents
- `8080` for HTTP for the API and Dashboard
- `6868` for RPC comunication between clients.

**Be sure you have opened this ports (or the ones that you configured) in your firewall or AWS security groups.**

By default dkron will try to use a local etcd server running in the same machine and in the default port. You can specify the store by setting the `backend` and `backend-machines` flag in the config file, env variables or as a command line flag.

To start a Dkron server instance just run:

```
dkron agent -server
```
