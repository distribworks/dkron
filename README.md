# Dkron - Distributed, fault tolerant job scheduling system for cloud native environments [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/distribworks/dkron?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/distribworks/dkron) [![Actions Status](https://github.com/distribworks/dkron/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/distribworks/dkron/actions) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/distribworks/dkron.svg)](https://gitter.im/distribworks/dkron)

Website: http://dkron.io/

Dkron is a distributed cron service, easy to setup and fault tolerant with focus in:

- Easy: Easy to use with a great UI
- Reliable: Completely fault tolerant
- High scalable: Able to handle high volumes of scheduled jobs and thousands of nodes

Dkron is written in Go and leverage the power of the Raft protocol and Serf for providing fault tolerance, reliability and scalability while keeping simple and easily installable.

Dkron is inspired by the google whitepaper [Reliable Cron across the Planet](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2745840) and by Airbnb Chronos borrowing the same features from it.

Dkron runs on Linux, OSX and Windows. It can be used to run scheduled commands on a server cluster using any combination of servers for each job. It has no single points of failure due to the use of the Gossip protocol and fault tolerant distributed databases.

You can use Dkron to run the most important part of your company, scheduled jobs.

## Installation

[Installation instructions](https://dkron.io/basics/installation/)

Full, comprehensive documentation is viewable on the [Dkron website](http://dkron.io)

## Development Quick start

The best way to test and develop dkron is using docker, you will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed before proceding.

Clone the repository.

Next, run the included Docker Compose config:

`docker-compose up`

This will start Dkron instances. To add more Dkron instances to the clusters:

```
docker-compose up --scale dkron-server=4
docker-compose up --scale dkron-agent=10
```

Check the port mapping using `docker-compose ps` and use the browser to navigate to the Dkron dashboard using one of the ports mapped by compose.

To add jobs to the system read the [API docs](https://dkron.io/api/).

## Frontend development

Dkron dashboard is built using [React Admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) as a single page application.

To start developing the dashboard enter the `ui` directory and run `npm install` to get the frontend dependencies and then start the local server with `npm start` it should start a new local web server and open a new browser window serving de web ui.

Make your changes to the code, then run `make ui` to generate assets files. This is a method of embedding resources in Go applications.
