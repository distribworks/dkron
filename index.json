	"content": " Welcome to the intro guide to dkron! This will explain how to setup dkron, how easy is to use it, what problems could it help you to solve, etc.\nIntroduction Dkron nodes can work in two modes, agents or servers.\nA Dkron agent is a cluster member that can handle job executions, run your scripts and return the resulting output to the server.\nA Dkron server is also a cluster member that send job execution queries to agents or other servers, so servers can execute jobs too.\nThe main distinction is that servers order job executions, can be used to schedule jobs, handles data storage and participate on leader election.\nDkron clusters have a leader, the leader is responsible of starting job execution queries in the cluster.\nAny Dkron agent or server acts as a cluster member and it\u0026rsquo;s available to run scheduled jobs.\nYou can choose whether a job is run on a node or nodes by specifying tags and a count of target nodes having this tag do you want a job to run. This gives an unprecedented level of flexibility in runnig jobs across a cluster of any size and with any combination of machines you need.\nAll the execution responses will be gathered by the scheduler and stored in the database.\nRequirements Dkron relies on the key-value store for data storage, you can run an instance of the distributed store in the same machines as Dkron or connect it to your existing cluster.\nIt can use etcd, Consul or Zookeeper as data stores. To install any of this systems got to their web site:\n etcd Consul ZooKeeper  Installation Recommended method APT repository: deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/victorcoder/ /\nUnstable release: sudo apt-get install dkron-unstable Stable release: sudo apt-get install dkron\nOther methods Simply download the packaged archive for your platform from the downloads page, extract the package to a shared location in your drive, like /opt/local and run it from there.\nConfiguration See the configuration section.\nUsage By default Dkron uses the following ports:\n 8946 for communicating between agents 8080 for HTTP for the API and Dashboard 6868 for RPC comunication between agents.  Be sure you have opened this ports (or the ones that you configured) in your firewall or AWS security groups.\nBy default dkron will try to use a local etcd server running in the same machine and in the default port. You can specify the store by setting the backend and backend-machines flag in the config file, env variables or as a command line flag.\nTo start a Dkron server instance just run:\ndkron agent --server  "

	"content": " Execution Processors Processor plugins are called when an execution response has been received. They are passed the resulting execution data and configuration parameters, this plugins can perform a variety of operations with the execution and it\u0026rsquo;s very flexible and per Job, examples of operations this plugins can do:\n Execution output storage, forwarding or redirection. Notification Monitoring  For example, Processor plugins can be used to redirect the output of a job execution to different targets.\nCurrently Dkron provides you with some built-in plugins but the list keeps growing. Some of the features previously implemented in the application will be progessively moved to plugins.\nBuilt-in processors Dkron provides the following built-in processors:\n not specified - Store the output in the key value store (Slow performance, good for testing, default method) log - Output the execution log to Dkron stdout (Good performance, needs parsing) syslog - Output to the syslog (Good performance, needs parsing) files - Output to multiple files (Good performance, needs parsing)  Dkro Pro provides you with several more processors.\nAll plugins accepts one configuration option: forward Indicated if the plugin must forward the original execution output. This allows for chaining plugins and sending output to different targets at the same time.\nYou can set more than one processor to a job. For example:\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;job_name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;command\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/bin/true\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;schedule\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;@every 2m\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;role\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;web\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;processors\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;files\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;forward\u0026quot;: true }, \u0026quot;syslog\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;forward\u0026quot;: true }, } }  "

If you don\u0026rsquo;t plan on writing any plugins, we recommend not reading the following section of the documentation. Developing a plugin is simple. The only knowledge necessary to write a plugin is basic command-line skills and basic knowledge of the Go programming language.\nNote: A common pitfall is not properly setting up a $GOPATH. This can lead to strange errors. You can read more about this here to familiarize yourself.\nCreate a new Go project somewhere in your $GOPATH. If you\u0026rsquo;re a GitHub user, we recommend creating the project in the directory $GOPATH/src/github.com/USERNAME/dkron-NAME-TYPE, where USERNAME is your GitHub username and NAME is the name of the plugin you\u0026rsquo;re developing. This structure is what Go expects and simplifies things down the road.\nWith the directory made, create a main.go file. This project will be a binary so the package is \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo;:\npackage main import ( \u0026quot;github.com/victorcoder/dkron/plugin\u0026quot; ) func main() { plugin.Serve(\u0026amp;plugin.ServeOpts{ Processor: new(MyPlugin), }) }  And that\u0026rsquo;s basically it! You\u0026rsquo;ll have to change the argument given to plugin.Serve to be your actual plugin, but that is the only change you\u0026rsquo;ll have to make. The argument should be a structure implementing one of the plugin interfaces (depending on what sort of plugin you\u0026rsquo;re creating).\nDkron plugins must follow a very specific naming convention of dkron-TYPE-NAME. For example, dkron-processor-files, which tells Dkron that the plugin is a processor that can be referenced as \u0026ldquo;files\u0026rdquo;.\n"

	"content": " Dkron - Distributed, fault tolerant job scheduling system Welcome to the Dkron documentation! This is the reference guide on how to use Dkron. If you want a getting started guide refer to the getting started guide.\nWhat is Dkron Dkron is a distributed system to run scheduled jobs against a server or a group of servers of any size. One of the machines is the leader and the others will be followers. If the leader fails or becomes unreachable, any other one will take over and reschedule all jobs to keep the system healthy.\nIn case the old leader becomes alive again, it\u0026rsquo;ll become a follower.\nDkron is a distributed cron drop-in replacement, easy to setup and fault tolerant with focus in:\n Easy: Easy to use with a great UI Reliable: Completely fault tolerant High scalable: Able to handle high volumes of scheduled jobs and thousands of nodes  Dkron is written in Go and leverage the power of distributed key value stores and Serf for providing fault tolerance, reliability and scalability while keeping simple and easily installable.\nDkron is inspired by the google whitepaper Reliable Cron across the Planet\nDkron runs on Linux, OSX and Windows. It can be used to run scheduled commands on a server cluster using any combination of servers for each job. It has no single points of failure due to the use of the fault tolerant distributed databases and can work at large scale thanks to the efficient and lightweight gossip protocol.\nDkron uses the efficient and lightweight gossip protocol underneath to communicate with nodes. Failure notification and task handling are run efficiently across an entire cluster of any size.\nWeb UI \nDkron design Dkron is designed to solve one problem well, executing commands in given intervals. Following the unix philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well (like the battle-tested cron) but with the given addition of being designed for the cloud era, removing single points of failure in environments where scheduled jobs are needed to be run in multiple servers.\n"

	"content": " What is Dkron Pro? Dkron Pro is a flavor of Dkron which add more functionality and provide additional support options for customers.\nIs there a trial version? There\u0026rsquo;s no free trial but we do offer a 14 day period with full refund if it does not work for you.\nCan I get a discount? I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;re very nice but no. Everyone pays the same price.\nWhat is the license? See COMM-LICENSE.\nHow does Pro licensing work? Every organization running Dkron Pro on its own servers must have a license. There\u0026rsquo;s no limit to the number of servers or environments used by that organization.\nWhat happens if my subscription lapses? You must have an active subscription to run Dkron Pro. After a one week grace period, you\u0026rsquo;ll lose access to the package repository and priority support. You won\u0026rsquo;t get any more updates or bug fixes and \u0026lsquo;apt-get install dkron-pro\u0026rsquo; won\u0026rsquo;t work anymore.\nCan I distribute Dkron Pro to my customers? This is a common requirement for \u0026ldquo;on-site installs\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;appliances\u0026rdquo; sold to large corporations.\nThe standard license is only appropriate for SaaS usage as it does not allow distribution. Dkron Pro have an Appliance license option which does allow you to distribute them. The Appliance license is $3,950/yr for Pro. It allows you to distribute the Pro binaries as part of your application and each of your customers to run Dkron Pro as part of your application only. Email support\u0026#64;distrib.works to purchase.\nCan you transfer a license? Licenses are not transferrable to another company. We will transfer the license from a user-specific email to a group email address (e.g. john_smith@example.com -\u0026gt; tech@example.com) but only for the same domain. It is strongly recommended that you buy the license using a group email address so the license is not attached to any one employee\u0026rsquo;s email address.\nWhat does the license require me to do? Your purchase gets you unique access credentials for downloading the Pro packages. The license agreement requires you to keep these access credentials private. If we find your access credentials are ever publicized:\n We\u0026rsquo;ll send you a warning email with details. You need to remove the content and send a new email address so we can generate new credentials for you. The old credentials will stop working immediately so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to update your apps. If your credentials are publicized a second time, we reserve the right to permanently remove access (but won\u0026rsquo;t unless it\u0026rsquo;s really egregious - sloppy contractors happen).  Can I get a refund? Yes, up to two weeks after purchase. Let us know the reason and maybe we can help but either way it\u0026rsquo;s not a problem. Email support\u0026#64;distrib.works.\nHow do I update my credit card info? If you purchased Dkron Pro (settings) with a credit card, log into Gumroad with your email address, click the Settings, enter your card info and hit Save. Follow instructions in Gumroad docs https://help.gumroad.com/how-do-i-update-my-credit-card-information I can\u0026rsquo;t provide support for the Gumroad website and don\u0026rsquo;t have the ability to edit customer info - if you can\u0026rsquo;t log in or change your credit card, you can always let your current subscription expire and purchase a new subscription.\nCan I request a change to the license terms? Dkron Pro is sold as is, no change to terms.\nCan I pay via invoice and purchase order? Dkron Pro is credit card only, no exceptions.\nContact Info Distributed Works\nAll billing/support inquiries: support@distrib.works\nPhone: not available\n"

	"content": " Settings for dkron can be specified in three ways: Using a config/dkron.json config file, using env variables starting with DKRON_ or using command line arguments.\nCommand line options  --node-name - Name of the node, must be unique in the cluster. By default this is the hostname of the machine.\n --bind-addr - The address that dkron will bind to for communication with other dkron nodes. By default this is \u0026ldquo;0.0.0.0:8946\u0026rdquo;. dkron nodes may have different ports. If a join is specified without a port, we default to locally configured port. dkron uses both TCP and UDP and use the same port for both, so if you have any firewalls be sure to allow both protocols. If this configuration value is changed and no port is specified, the default of \u0026ldquo;8946\u0026rdquo; will be used.\n --join - Address of another agent to join upon starting up. This can be specified multiple times to specify multiple agents to join. If Dkron is unable to join with any of the specified addresses, agent startup will fail. By default, the agent won\u0026rsquo;t join any nodes when it starts up.\n --advertise-addr - The advertise flag is used to change the address that we advertise to other nodes in the cluster. By default, the bind address is advertised. However, in some cases (specifically NAT traversal), there may be a routable address that cannot be bound to. This flag enables gossiping a different address to support this. If this address is not routable, the node will be in a constant flapping state, as other nodes will treat the non-routability as a failure.\n --http-addr - The address where the web UI will be binded. By default :8080\n --backend - Backend storage to use, etcd, consul, zk (zookeeper) or redis. The default is etcd.\n --backend-machine - Backend storage servers addresses to connect to. This flag can be specified multiple times. By default 127.0.0.1:2379\n --tag - The tag flag is used to associate a new key/value pair with the agent. The tags are gossiped and can be used to provide additional information such as roles, ports, and configuration values to other nodes. Multiple tags can be specified per agent. There is a byte size limit for the maximum number of tags, but in practice dozens of tags may be used. Tags can be changed during a config reload.\n --server - If this agent is a dkron server, just need to be present. Absent by default.\n --keyspace - Keyspace to use for the store. Allows to run different instances using the same storage cluster. dkron by default.\n --encrypt - Key for encrypting network traffic. Must be a base64-encoded 16-byte key.\n --mail-host - Mail server host address to use for notifications.\n --mail-port - Mail server port.\n --mail-username - Mail server username used for authentication.\n --mail-password - Mail server password to use.\n --mail-from - From email address to use.\n --webhook-url - Webhook url to call for notifications.\n --webhook-payload - Body of the POST request to send on webhook call.\n --webhook-header - Headers to use when calling the webhook URL. Can be specified multiple times.\n --log-level - Set the log level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal, panic). Defaults to \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo;\n --rpc-port - The port that Dkron will use to bind for the agent\u0026rsquo;s RPC server, defaults to 6868.

	"content": " CRON Expression Format A cron expression represents a set of times, using 6 space-separated fields.\nField name | Mandatory? | Allowed values | Allowed special characters ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------- Seconds | Yes | 0-59 | * / , - Minutes | Yes | 0-59 | * / , - Hours | Yes | 0-23 | * / , - Day of month | Yes | 1-31 | * / , - ? Month | Yes | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | * / , - Day of week | Yes | 0-6 or SUN-SAT | * / , - ?  Note: Month and Day-of-week field values are case insensitive. \u0026ldquo;SUN\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Sun\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;sun\u0026rdquo; are equally accepted.\nSpecial Characters\nAsterisk ( * )\nThe asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of the field; e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate every month.\nSlash ( / )\nSlashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59\u0026frasl;15 in the 1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter. The form \u0026ldquo;*\\/\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; is equivalent to the form \u0026ldquo;first-last/\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, that is, an increment over the largest possible range of the field. The form \u0026ldquo;N/\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; is accepted as meaning \u0026ldquo;N-MAX/\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, that is, starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range. It does not wrap around.\nComma ( , )\nCommas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using \u0026ldquo;MON,WED,FRI\u0026rdquo; in the 5th field (day of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.\nHyphen ( - )\nHyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour between 9am and 5pm inclusive.\nQuestion mark ( ? )\nQuestion mark may be used instead of \u0026lsquo;*\u0026rsquo; for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank.\nPredefined schedules You may use one of several pre-defined schedules in place of a cron expression.\nEntry | Description | Equivalent To ----- | ----------- | ------------- @yearly (or @annually) | Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st | 0 0 0 1 1 * @monthly | Run once a month, midnight, first of month | 0 0 0 1 * * @weekly | Run once a week, midnight on Sunday | 0 0 0 * * 0 @daily (or @midnight) | Run once a day, midnight | 0 0 0 * * * @hourly | Run once an hour, beginning of hour | 0 0 * * * * @minutely | Run once a minute, beginning of minute | 0 * * * * *  Intervals You may also schedule a job to execute at fixed intervals. This is supported by formatting the cron spec like this:\n@every \u0026lt;duration\u0026gt;  where \u0026ldquo;duration\u0026rdquo; is a string accepted by time.ParseDuration (http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).\nFor example, \u0026ldquo;@every 1h30m10s\u0026rdquo; would indicate a schedule that activates every 1 hour, 30 minutes, 10 seconds.\nNote: The interval does not take the job runtime into account. For example, if a job takes 3 minutes to run, and it is scheduled to run every 5 minutes, it will have only 2 minutes of idle time between each run.\nFixed times You may also want to schedule a job to be executed once. This is supported by formatting the cron spec like this:\n@at \u0026lt;datetime\u0026gt;  Where \u0026ldquo;datetime\u0026rdquo; is a string accepted by time.Parse in RFC3339 format (https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Parse).\nFor example, \u0026ldquo;@at 2018-01-02T15:04:00Z\u0026rdquo; would run the job on the specified date and time assuming UTC timezone.\nTime zones Dkron is able to schedule jobs in time zones, if you specify the timezone parameter in a job definition.\nIf the time zone is not specified, the following rules apply:\nAll interpretation and scheduling is done in the machine\u0026rsquo;s local time zone (as provided by the Go time package (http://www.golang.org/pkg/time).\nBe aware that jobs scheduled during daylight-savings leap-ahead transitions will not be run!\nIf you specify timezone the job will be schduled taking into account daylight-savings and leap-ahead transitions, running the job in the actual time in the specified time zone.\n"

This works out of the box on each node dkron server is started. This ensures a dead easy install and setup, basically run dkron and you will have a full working node and at the same time provides you with a fully tested well supported store for its use with dkron. Configuration The embedded etcd instance configuration can be tunned using the standard etcd config yaml file located in config/etcd.\n  Encryption SSL encryption is used for communicating dkron pro and the embedded store, and between storage nodes itself. Also client auth is enabled, so only dkron pro clients can talk to the embedded store. This means that no other software running on your local network will be able to talk to dkron\u0026rsquo;s etcd server. This ensures that no unexpected usage of the Dkron\u0026rsquo;s store will happen, unless it is another Dkron pro instance.\n  "

	"content": " This document is a WIP, it\u0026rsquo;s intended to describe the reasons that lead to design decisions in Dkron.\nExecution results Dkron store the result of each job execution in each node.\nEvery time dkron executes a job it assigns it an execution group, generating a new uuid and send a serf query to target machines and waits for a response.\nEach target machine that will run the job, then responds with an execution object saying it started to run the job.\nThis allows dkron to know how many machines will be running the job.\nThe design takes into account the differences of how the different storage backends work.\nDue to this issue https://github.com/docker/libkv/issues/20 executions are grouped using the group id in the execution object.\nExecutions commands output When a node has finished executing a job it gathers the output of the executed command and sends it back to the a server using an RPC call. This is designed after two main reasons:\n Scallability, in case of thousands of nodes responding to job the responses are sent to dkron servers in an evenly way selecting a random Dkron server of the ones that are available at the moment and send the response. In the future, Dkron should retry sending the command result with an exponential backoff.\n Due to the limitations of Serf the queries payload can\u0026rsquo;t be bigger that 1KB, this renders impossible to send a minimal command output togheter with the execution metadata.\n  "

The exact interface to implement is documented in its respective documentation section.\nInstalling a Plugin Dkron searches for plugins at startup, to install a plugin just drop the binary in one of the following locations:\n /etc/dkron/plugins Dkron executable directory   Execution Processors   Executors   Developing plugins   "
