### Upgrade notes

Due to the change in the internal tags `server` to `dkron_server`, you'll need to adjust job tags if they where using that tag.

## 0.7.1 (2016-05-03)

- Don't use shell call when executing commands, exploding the command line.

## 0.7.0 (2016-04-10)

- Refactor leader election, the old method could lead to cases where 2 or more nodes could have the scheduler running without noticing the other master.
- Get rid of `keys`, in a serf cluster node names are unique so using it for leader keys now.
- Fix [#85](https://github.com/victorcoder/dkron/issues/85) Restart scheduler on job deletion
- Refactor logging, replace `debug` with `log-level`
- Order nodes in UI [#81](https://github.com/victorcoder/dkron/issues/81) (kudos @whizz)

- Add @minutely as predefined schedule (kudos @mlafeldt)
