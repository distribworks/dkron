## New Features

### Run Dkron as a Single Binary

The new release includes the ability to run Dkron as a single binary, as it embeds the shell plugin. This makes it even easier and faster to get started with Dkron for simple cron job management, especially for those who only need to run shell jobs.

### Docker Light Image

We are thrilled to announce the release of a new Docker light image for Dkron v4.0.0-beta1. This image contains only the main Dkron binary with the built-in shell plugin and no other plugins, all in a single file. If you're looking for a lean and efficient way to run Dkron, this is it! You can find the image on Docker Hub.

### Reporting Issues

As this is a beta release, we encourage users to report any issues they encounter to help us make the final release even better. Your feedback is essential in ensuring that the final release meets your expectations.

### Changelog
The release includes a substantial list of changes, including the bumping of various dependencies, clean up in CI, handling of IP changes, removal of the old UI, and many more improvements and fixes. You can view the [full changelog here](https://github.com/distribworks/dkron/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta1).

We are looking forward to your feedback on this beta release, and we hope that Dkron v4.0 Beta will bring added value and convenience to your cron job management.

Happy scheduling! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰
