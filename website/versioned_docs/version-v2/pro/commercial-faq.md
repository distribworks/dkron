### What is Dkron Pro?

Dkron Pro is a flavor of Dkron which add more functionality and provide additional support options for customers.

### Is there a trial version?

There's no free trial but we do offer a 14 day period with full refund if it does not work for you.

### Can I get a discount?

I'm sure you're very nice but no. Everyone pays the same price.

### What is the license?

See [COMM-LICENSE](https://github.com/distribworks/dkron/blob/master/COMM-LICENSE).

### How does Pro licensing work?

Every organization running Dkron Pro on its own servers must have a license. There's no limit to the number of servers or environments used by that organization.

### What happens if my subscription lapses?

You must have an active subscription to run Dkron Pro. After a one week grace period, you'll lose access to the package repository and priority support. You won't get any more updates or bug fixes and `apt-get install dkron-pro` won't work anymore.

### Can I distribute Dkron Pro to my customers?

This is a common requirement for "on-site installs" or "appliances" sold to large corporations.

The standard license is only appropriate for SaaS usage as it does not allow distribution. Dkron Pro have an Appliance license option which **does** allow you to distribute them. The Appliance license is $7,500/yr for Pro. It allows you to distribute the Pro binaries as part of your application and each of your customers to run Dkron Pro **as part of your application only**. Email [support&#64;distrib.works](mailto:support&#64;distrib.works) to purchase.

### Can you transfer a license?

Licenses are **not** transferrable to another company.  We will transfer the license from a user-specific email to a group email address (e.g. john_smith@example.com -> tech@example.com) but only for **the same domain**.  It is strongly recommended that you buy the license using a group email address so the license is not attached to any one employee's email address.

### What does the license require me to do?

Your purchase gets you unique access credentials for downloading the Pro packages. The license agreement requires you to keep these access credentials private.  If we find your access credentials are ever publicized:

1. We'll send you a warning email with details.  You need to remove the content and send a new email address so we can generate new credentials for you.  The old credentials will stop working immediately so you'll need to update your apps.
2. If your credentials are publicized a second time, we reserve the right to permanently remove access (but won't unless it's really egregious - sloppy contractors happen).

### Can I get a refund?

Yes, up to two weeks after purchase. Let us know the reason and maybe we can help but either way it's not a problem. Email [support&#64;distrib.works](mailto:support&#64;distrib.works).

### How do I update my credit card info?

If you purchased Dkron Pro ([settings](https://gumroad.com/settings)) with a credit card, log into Gumroad with your email address, click the Settings, enter your card info and hit Save. Follow instructions in Gumroad docs https://help.gumroad.com/how-do-i-update-my-credit-card-information I can't provide support for the Gumroad website and don't have the ability to edit customer info - if you can't log in or change your credit card, you can always let your current subscription expire and purchase a new subscription.

## Can I request a change to the license terms?

Dkron Pro purchasing the Appliance license can ask for changes to the terms and conditions. Email your concerns and we can negotiate something.

## Can I pay via invoice and purchase order?

Dkron Pro is credit card only, no exceptions.
