## dkron

Open source distributed job scheduling system

### Synopsis

Dkron is a system service that runs scheduled jobs at given intervals or times,
just like the cron unix service but distributed in several machines in a cluster.
If a machine fails (the leader), a follower will take over and keep running the scheduled jobs without human intervention.

### Options

```
      --config string   config file path
  -h, --help            help for dkron
```
