Dkron is very reliable but sometimes a very bad event can bring your cluster down to its knees. To provide multiple options to monitor Dkron, I'm happy to introduce a new way to monitor your job executions using Cronitor service.</p><p>Cronitor is tightly integrated with Dkron, it will notify the details of every execution and Cronitor can offer multiple channels for alerting you in case something goes wrong.</p><p>Check the service <a href="https://cronitor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cronitor.io/</a> and follow the integration guide in the docs to set up your <a href="/docs/usage/cronitor">Dkron-Cronitor integration</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="openapi">OpenAPI<a class="hash-link" href="#openapi" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We have migrated API docs from Swagger 2 spec to OpenAPI 3 format. Check the new and better <a href="/api">API docs</a> and you can download the new <a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/openapi-a0949dbed9caf9b36b8e74f84fe55a61.yaml">OpenAPI spec</a> too.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="upcoming-features">Upcoming features<a class="hash-link" href="#upcoming-features" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The new look of Dkron will pave the road for the upcoming v4 release. We have really interesting features almost ready for the new version, some of them are:</p><ul><li>Bump React Admin to v4.0</li><li>Shell plugin will be included in the main binary</li><li>New light image including only the main binary</li><li>Optionally use fast-store instead of boltdb for Raft log, this will improve performance tenfold</li><li>Farewell to the old UI</li></ul><p>We think this will open Dkron to be used for new use cases that where not possible before.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="wrap-up">Wrap-up<a class="hash-link" href="#wrap-up" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We are very happy of giving Dkron a well deserved new face to the world and also to keep integrating with new services we love to be able to offer the best product we can for this specific -and niche- market.</p><p>We think there's a gap in Job schedulers for the rest-of-us that is currently improving, but still very needed of cost-effective and easy to operate solutions like Dkron for small-mid start-ups and for specific needs in bigger companies.</p><p>We're always open to our users feedback so feel free to contact us if you have any suggestion.</p>]]></content>
