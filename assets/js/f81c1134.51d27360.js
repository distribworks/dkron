To provide multiple options to monitor Dkron, I\'m happy to introduce a new way to monitor your job executions using Cronitor service.\\n\\nCronitor is tightly integrated with Dkron, it will notify the details of every execution and Cronitor can offer multiple channels for alerting you in case something goes wrong.\\n\\nCheck the service https://cronitor.io/ and follow the integration guide in the docs to set up your [Dkron-Cronitor integration](/docs/usage/cronitor).\\n\\n### OpenAPI\\n\\nWe have migrated API docs from Swagger 2 spec to OpenAPI 3 format. Check the new and better [API docs](/api) and you can download the new [OpenAPI spec](/openapi/openapi.yaml) too.\\n## Upcoming features\\n\\nThe new look of Dkron will pave the road for the upcoming v4 release.
