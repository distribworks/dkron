  title: Dkron REST API
  description: |
    You can communicate with Dkron using a RESTful JSON API over HTTP. Dkron nodes usually listen on port `8080` for API requests. All examples in this section assume that you've found a running leader at `localhost:8080`.

    Dkron implements a RESTful JSON API over HTTP to communicate with software clients. Dkron listens in port `8080` by default. All examples in this section assume that you're using the default port.

    Default API responses are unformatted JSON add the `pretty=true` param to format the response.
